# Joing Savings Contract
Smart Contracts with Solidity

This is code for a joint savings account on the Ethereum Blockchain.
The joint_savings_completed.sol file has the code for a contract that can be withdrawn from two different addresses.
This allows two people to share funds in one contract address, and includes safeguards against unauthorized use.

The Execution_Results folder shows the functionality with examples of deposits and withdrawals.
